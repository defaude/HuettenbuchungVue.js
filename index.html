        <h1>This is a demo page!</h1>
        <p>
            This page always shows the latest version. Just code, refresh, code, refresh, ...
        </p>

        <h2>What exactly is happening here?</h2>
        <p>
            As soon as your Vue app starts, it will look for the element with the id "huettenbuchung", delete its
            contentsand assume control over that element. The whole bundling, precompiling, etc. is all done by
            steal.js. Whenever you like your current dev state, just stop your http server and run
            <code>npm run build</code>. This will bundle all the stuff into the "dist" folder.

            Then, basically just copy the whole dist folder to your web server and include
            dist/bundles/HuettenbuchungVue.js/index.js in a page where the "huettenbuchung" id is given to an element.

            (see <a href="prod-demo.html">prod-demo.html</a> for an example.
        </p>

        <div id="huettenbuchung">loading...</div>
        <script src="node_modules/steal/steal.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
